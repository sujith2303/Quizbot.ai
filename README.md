# What is QuizBot.AI
<p>This initiative presents a platform that swiftly generates questions and answers by analyzing video, image, or PDF files. Users can easily upload their files through a user-friendly interface, and within seconds, a diverse set of questions is generated.
   These questions include essay prompts, multiple-choice queries, true or false statements, and fill-in-the-blank exercises. The system also incorporates an automated grading feature, providing instant feedback on user responses.
  Tailored for students, this project serves as an invaluable tool for mock testing before examinations. As a freely accessible resource, users can take advantage of multiple attempts across various topics, enhancing their confidence and preparation for upcoming exams.

An extension of this project introduces an <b>AI-based interview system</b>, where the AI engages with candidates, formulates questions based on their resumes, and assesses their responses in real-time. The model leverages up-to-date data to evaluate candidate responses and adaptively generate follow-up questions. The motivation behind developing this project stems from the prevalent issue of candidates being rejected by Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software, limiting their opportunities. Many candidates resort to tailoring their resumes to match job descriptions, effectively "hacking" the ATS tracker. To address this, the AI_Interviewer project aims to provide a fairer assessment by utilizing a machine learning model. This approach enables parallel usage and scalability, facilitating simultaneous interviews for multiple candidates. The system evaluates scores to determine whether an in-person interview is warranted, thereby mitigating the reliance on ATS-driven rejections and promoting a more comprehensive candidate evaluation process.
